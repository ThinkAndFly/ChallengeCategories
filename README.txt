Hi, I'm Juan!

This proyect was structured using Clean Architecture, and does a light usage of dependency injection to load the categories, and perform the requested functionality.
It also includes unit tests to assert the expected functionality.

The Presentation.Console project can be run to test the two exercises.
The console outputs the available commands.

It took me about 2 and a half hours in total setting up the repository, building the architecture and creating the tests. 
I took my time to add these features that were not in the description of the excercise but I believe they make the solution stronger.
